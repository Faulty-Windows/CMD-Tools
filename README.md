# CMD-Tools
This is an BAT file that incluldes some CMD tools, and some basic ones too. There are some tools such as DoS, careful! Using these tools against someone is strictly prohibited. This is for educational purposes, also is used for testing your site's DDOS or DOS protection. It is strictly prohibited. There are also basic tools.

Note some stuff may not work on older versions of Windows. I don't think the DoS tool will work in Windows XP, but the Create Txt tool will definitely not work because in Windows XP, the desktop is in a different directory.

There are more tools!
